I started this project by developing a brief <a href="mvp/mvp-personas.pdf" target="_blank">persona</a> for each of the predefined segments to gain a better understanding of who the target users were. Utilizing this work, I then designed a series of wireframes to plan the architecture and content flow for the site.
