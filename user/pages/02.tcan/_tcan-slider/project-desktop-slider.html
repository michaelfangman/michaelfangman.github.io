<p>My goal while defining the site&#8217;s look and feel was to bring the same excitement and vibrance one might feel at a professional networking event into the design of the website. Using the organization&#8217;s existing brand platform as a jumping off point, I employed the use of subtle gradients, bold fonts, and engaging interactions to help bring this vision to life.</p>
