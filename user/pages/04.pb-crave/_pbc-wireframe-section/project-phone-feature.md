With a sitemap and list of requirements in hand, I put pen to paper sketching out low-fidelity wireframes. My focus during this phase was to create a clear flow from one page to the next that would offer users a superb experience. To more accurately represent the site structure, I transformed the sketches into high-fidelity wireframes and connected them together using InVision.
