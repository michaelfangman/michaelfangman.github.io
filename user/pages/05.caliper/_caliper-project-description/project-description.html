<p>Caliper is seasoned a consulting firm that specializes in helping business with talent management, leadership development, and organizational change. While they offer their clientele industry-leading talent management solutions, their 3-year old website framed them as a company playing catch up. Beyond that, Caliper was quickly realizing their existing site wasn&#8217;t exactly scalable. It was time for a redesign.</p>

<p>Caliper hoped to accomplish several things with the new site. The main objectives of the project were to reorganize the content structure into a more scalable format and redesign the page-level layouts so that they are more inviting and easier to comprehend.</p>
